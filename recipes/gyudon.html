        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Neutral oil</li>
                <li>2 medium onions, very thinly sliced</li>
                <li>1 lb thinly sliced beef</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons sugar</li>
                <li>2 tbsp mirin</li>
                <li>2 tbsp soy sauce</li>
                <li>1 cup dashi stock</li>
                <li>4 eggs</li>
                <li>4 cups cooked white rice</li>
                <li>1 green onion stalk for garnish</li>
                <li>2 tsp toasted sesame seeds</li>
            </ul>
            <ol>
                <li>Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large skillet over medium high heat, and cook the sliced onions for about 10 minutes, stirring often.</li>
                <li>Add the beef and sugar, and cook until the beef is slightly browned. Add the mirin, soy sauce, and stock. Bring to a simmer, and cook for about 10-15 minutes to reduce the stock into a thin sauce. Taste for seasoning, and add a little more soy sauce if needed.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, heat another couple tablespoons of oil in a cast iron or non-stick skillet. Cook the eggs sunny-side up. You can cook them in batches if needed. The yolks should still be runny!</li>
                <li>When the beef is done simmering, divide the rice among 4 bowls, and top with the beef and an egg for each bowl. Garnish with chopped scallion and toasted sesame seeds, if using.</li>
            </ol>
