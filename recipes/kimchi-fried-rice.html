        <h2>Easy Kimchi Fried Rice</h2>
            <p>Kimchi fried rice is a fantastic dish for utilizing leftover rice.
                You've probably heard that one or two-day-old rice fries better. Let me clarify this concept. Freshly cooked rice tends to be moist and soft, and when stir-fried, it can become gluggy-not an appealing texture for a stir fry dish!</p>
            <p>However, if you're skilled at managing the water content, you can also use freshly cooked rice. Simply prepare the rice to be intentionally drier by adding slightly less water during the rice cooking process.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1 cup kimchi, cut into thumnail size pieces</li>
                <li>150g bacon, cut into thumbnail size pieces</li>
                <li>3 cups steamed white short/medium grain rice</li>
                <li>4 eggs, cooked per your preference</li>
                <li>1/2 tsp minced garlic</li>
                <li>1/4 cup kimchi juice</li>
                <li>1/2 tbsp sesame oil</li>
                <li>1/2 tbsp cooking oil</li>
                <li>1 to 2 tbsp roasted sesame seeds, for garnish</li>
                <li>1-2 stalks green onion, thinly sliced</li>
                <li>roasted seasoned seaweed, shredded</li>
            </ul>

            <ol>
                <li>On medium high heat preheat a pan/wok and once heated, add the cooking oil and spread it well with a spatula.</li>

                <li>Add the kimchi to the pan, stirring until it's 80% cooked.</li>
                <li>(Optional) Add the mushrooms and mix them well for a few seconds. Reduce the heat to medium-medium low.</li>
                <li>Add the rice and the kimchi juice. Mix all of them together well and thoroughly.</li>
                <li>Add the sesame oil and mix them well. Remove the pan from the heat.</li>
