        <h2>Classic Filipino Chicken Adobo</h2>
            <p>This is one of the most popular Filipino dishes, and also one of the easiest to make.
                Nearly any protein can be made into adobo, but for this recipe we will be using
                the classic chicken drumstick and thighs
            </p>
            <p>
                If possible, it is best to use Filipino brand soy sauce and vinegar if you can find
                them. Try your local asian grocery store.

            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>1/2 cup white vinegar</li>
                    <li>1/2 cup soy sauce</li>
                    <li>8 cloves garlic, minced</li>
                    <li>1/2 tsp black peppercorns</li>
                    <li>2 bay leaves</li>
                    <li>1 1/2 tbsp brown sugar</li>
                    <li>2 bonless chicken thighs, 2 drumsticks</li>
                    <li>1 tbsp canola oil</li>
                    <li>4 green onions, thinly sliced</li>
                    <li>Steamed rice, for serving</li>
                </ul>
                
                <ol>
                    <li>In a large bowl, combine the vinegar, soy sauce, garlic, peppercorns, bay leaves and brown sugar. Add the chicken and toss to coat. Cover the bowl and place it in the refrigerator for at least one hour, and up to three.</li>
                    <li>In a large skillet over medium-high heat, warm the canola oil until glistening. Add the chicken (letting as much marinade drip off as possible) to the pan. Brown the chicken thighs on both sides, about 6 minutes total.</li>
                    <li>Add the remaining marinade to the skillet and bring to a boil. Lower the heat to medium to maintain a heavy simmer for 10 minutes. Flip the chicken thighs. Simmer, stirring occasionally, until the sauce has reduced by half and is beginning to thicken, about 10 more minutes. When the chicken thigh reads 165Â°F on an instant-read thermometer, remove from the heat.</li>
                    <li>Serve the chicken thighs over cooked rice, sprinkled with green onions.</li>
                </ol>
